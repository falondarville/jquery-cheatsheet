	<h1 id="main-title">Information About Veganism</h1>

	<p id="intro-text">Having a vegan diet, or being a vegan, means that you do not consume any animal products and by-products. Vegans choose this lifestyle for a number of reasons.</p>

	<h3>Reasons that People Become Vegan</h3>

	<p>The environment suffers at the hands of animal raising. According to downtoearth.org, "In addition to having the advantage of <em>immediately reducing global warming</em>, shifting away from methane-emitting food sources is much easier than cutting carbon dioxide: First, greenhouse gas reductions through a vegetarian diet are limitless." </p>

	<p id="second-paragraph">Animal rights are one of the main arguments for going vegan. navs-online.org says "Every day — often without thinking — we make a series of small decisions about the foods we put in our bodies. Recognizing that you alone decide what to eat is the first step in ending animal cruelty. While many people find this intimidating, it can also be empowering."</p>

	<p id="third-paragraph">A satisfying effect of going vegan is that it tends to be better for your health. That is, as long as you're not just on the Oreo diet (Oreos are vegan). Vegans tend to be more lean, eat more nutritious foods (since they have to get creative about meeting their daily needs), have lower blood pressure, have improved liver function, and more.</p>
