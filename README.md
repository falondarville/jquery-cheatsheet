#JQuery Cheatsheet

Hello! I've compiled this cheatsheet of some of the great things that JQuery can do for manipulating HTML and CSS. I wrote all of these out based on Derek Banas' YouTube video on JQuery. 

[View the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWXggB-T1jQ&feature=youtu.be&t=37m37s)

Please note that I created the HTML document, and it is not identical to the one in Banas' video. I used components that I wanted to play around with. Don't mind the subject either!

I commented out some of the code. This is code that conflicts with other functionality in the JQuery file, or that is annoying in appearing every time I tried to create new functionality. 

I hope that you find it useful!
